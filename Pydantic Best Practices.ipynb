Now as someone who never know anything about Pydantic. help me understand and learn best practices of Pydantic library used on regular bases, and also help me learn how its useful while using in different use case like in OOPs concepts dependent related projects or APIs or decorater heavy project etc., things I need to know in Pydantic before learning langchain and FastAPI. for teaching me all this you can help me create an google colab notebook ipynb file where you are first explaining a component, concept or practices, then explaining it through a simple program through sample code that can help me understand those component, concept or practices completely. make sure to create proper markdown and comments with flowchart(if required and can use tags and all for masrkdown) so I can understand theory, concepts, flow and maths that works behind during that component, concept or practices, make sure to keep the explaination brief short and beginner-friendly. Make sure to keep the examples you provide for the respective pydantic component, concept or practices diverse. use some example that utilises one of any OOPs concepts (Encapsulation, Abstraction {abstract method/class}, Inheritence {different types}, Polymorphism (overriding or constructor{__init__} or destructor{__del__} or OperatorOverloading)) in defferent examples but must cover all the mentioned OOPs concepts through various examples, utilise super/self in some example, utilise decorators, Closures in some examples, Iterables, Iterators, Generators in some example, Advance Python Concepts (Lambda Operator,Filter, Reduce, Map, Recursive Functions, RegEx, Memory Management, Garbage Collection, How does reference counting work in Python?, How dynamic typing works?, Mutable & Immutable objects, Memory Profiling, Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy, Optimization Tips for Python Code, How Python store the integers in the memory?, Testing with Pytest, DocTests, UnitTests) in some example, All I want to say is keep the examples diverse for different component seperate for all the components I wrote with pydantic, concept or practices of pydantic.
